# Time-Calculator
The `add_time` function in Python calculates the new time after adding a specified duration to a starting time, while handling day transitions and AM/PM formatting. It accepts three parameters: the starting time, the duration to add, and an optional day of the week. The function validates and processes inputs, computes the new time, and adjusts for transitions between AM and PM, including scenarios where multiple days pass. 

If a day is provided, the function updates the day of the week accordingly and includes it in the output, reflecting how many days have passed. Without a day input, it simply calculates the new time, noting additional days as "next day" or specifying how many days later the result is.
